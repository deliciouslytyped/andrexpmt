This project implements an Android app runnable on my android 9 phone, for my android app dev course.

Requirements:
- [x] Jetpack compose: All UI (and game rendering) is implemented with compose.
- [x] LazyColumn: The integrated log viewer uses LazyColumn.
- [x] Jetpack Compose Navigation: The home screen to game transition is handled by jetpack compose navigation.
- [] database backend: the Repository pattern is used to sync a local score database (not that this makes sense) 
  - [x] Room: very basic score table implementation (TODO currently there is no way to submit new information to the DBs)
  - [x] Retrofit / OkHTTP / ??: very basic retrofit impl is used to retrieve "scores" from the simple python HTTP score server  (TODO see above)
    - TODO: follow UI event/show loading pattern
- [] Preferences DataStore: used to store dark or light theme setting (just because its a homework requirement), and the game server address
- data - repository - viewmodel - ui demonstration beyond MVC

Extra:
- [x] Dagger/Hilt dependency injection (for viewmodels as well)
- [] Supabase
- [] Fragment? (Parallel games maybe? -> Use DB to save them etc)

Extra (Infra):
- [] Unit testing
- [] Integration testing (?)
- [x] Automated UI testing
  - TODO not really but we use it to generate screenshots
- [x] CI Invokes Tests
- [] CI Invokes real device tests with that one service

Extra (Game server):
- Currently there is just a simple python HTTP server providing "scores"
- This is "packaged" as a Dockerfile

Architecture:
"single activity architecture"  (?)
"mvc" variant (TODO: the code doesn't feel clean enough yet)
- [] Only the UI/rendering code should be platform dependent
- kotlin api (instead of gradle) build system, gradle wrapper

Misc:
- [x] game logging is viewable from the device with integrated log viewer (don't need to use logcat)
  - this uses kotlin-logging/slf4j/(android-)logback to log to the standard logcat appender as well as our own log buffer implementation
    - the log buffer broadcasts messages via SharedFlow (or something) and the UI viewer collects these and displays them
    - TODO the implementation is still messy
    - currently using logback xml config though there may be advantages to programmatic

Misc TODO:
- [x] (autogenerated) screenshots
- [] (autogenerated) video demo

Resulting artefacts:
Overall the project (CI) should result in two artifacts which can be run to run the game and the game server respectively:
- [x] The APK (TODO well its whatever I got out of the build system at this point, it's some debug apk)
- [] The server OCI image

Additional artefacts:
- [] Screenshots and apk on pages:
