This project implements an Android app runnable on my android 9 phone, for my android app dev course.

Requirements:
- [x] Jetpack compose: All UI (and game rendering) is implemented with compose.
- [x] LazyColumn: The integrated log viewer uses LazyColumn.
- [x] Jetpack Compose Navigation: The home screen to game transition is handled by jetpack compose navigation.
- [] Room
- [] Retrofit / OkHTTP / ??
- [] Preferences DataStore
- data - repository - viewmodel - ui demonstration beyond MVC
- [] Fragment? (Parallel games maybe? -> Use DB to save them etc)

Extra:
- [] Dagger/Hilt dependency injection
- [] Supabase

Extra (Infra):
- [] Unit testing
- [] Integration testing (?)
- [] Automated UI testing
- [] CI Invokes Tests
- [] CI Invokes real device tests with that one service

Architecture:
"single activity architecture"  (?)
"mvc" variant (TODO: the code doesn't feel clean enough yet)
- [] Only the UI/rendering code should be platform dependent
- kotlin api (instead of gradle) build system, gradle wrapper

Misc:
- [x] game logging is viewable from the device with integrated log viewer (don't need to use logcat)
  - this uses kotlin-logging/slf4j/(android-)logback to log to the standard logcat appender as well as our own log buffer implementation
    - the log buffer broadcasts messages via SharedFlow (or something) and the UI viewer collects these and displays them
    - TODO the implementation is still messy
    - currently using logback xml config though there may be advantages to programmatic

Misc TODO:
- [] (autogenerated) screenshots
- [] (autogenerated) video demo
